# W40k-Conversion-Corner
Warhammer with less restrictions 
This all started because of the astra militarum
And the fact that the squad sergeant can't have
A lasgun. The greatest mankind can offer, the 
Tempestus Scions who were unable to get hot-
Shot laspistols. Why can't named characters 
Like Gabriel Seth upgrade to a jump pack when
In story they're strap one on for a mission?
Or why can't my space marine captain or my 
Chaos lord not tote around a heavy weapon?
I know it's balance but if you can convert it
That way why not just throw caution to the 
Wind and play the way you want to play?

This is why I'm trying (clumsily) to create this
A way to truly enact rule of cool in your models
And army and play them exactly as you see them.
